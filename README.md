To get the plots and the result, just run each file individually. Detailed explanations of the resulting graphs and results are showned in the report. Besides some the basic libraries like pandas, seaborn, sklearn, numpy, you may also want to install plotly.
You will need the data from https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py and https://github.com/kjhealy/us-county/blob/master/data/geojson/gz_2010_us_040_00_5m.json . Rename the previous data as "Data.csv".
